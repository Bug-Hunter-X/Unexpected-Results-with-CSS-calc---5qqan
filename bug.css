The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes it can produce unexpected results if the units are not consistent or if there are errors in the calculation. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` is fine, but `calc(100% - 10)` may not be interpreted correctly because 10 is not specified as px or any other unit. Another common issue is the order of operations not being followed as expected. Using spaces inconsistently might affect `calc()`'s functionality.
